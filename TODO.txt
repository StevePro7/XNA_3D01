01.
Ground.x
can I convert *.x file to *.fbx
could possible do with Unwrap software but have to pay

otherwise for the ground / grass - could I use the grass in XNA 1.0 demos?
this uses 2x primitive triangles and textured shader


02.
Custom shader

Windows
graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this);

GraphicsProfile gp1 = graphics.GraphicsProfile;
graphics.GraphicsProfile = GraphicsProfile.HiDef;
GraphicsProfile gp2 = graphics.GraphicsProfile;

whereas Android and iOS have these [new] lines of code commented out
what happens if I leave these lines in when doing Android and iOS



error rendering *.x files

System.InvalidOperationException: 'An error occurred while preparing to draw. This is probably because the current vertex declaration does not include all the elements required by the current vertex shader. The current vertex declaration includes these elements: SV_Position0, COLOR0.'


This exception was originally thrown at this call stack:
	SharpDX.Result.CheckError()
	SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateInputLayout(SharpDX.Direct3D11.InputElement[], int, System.IntPtr, SharpDX.PointerSize, SharpDX.Direct3D11.InputLayout)
	SharpDX.Direct3D11.InputLayout.InputLayout(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device, byte[], SharpDX.Direct3D11.InputElement[])
	Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.InputLayoutCache.GetOrCreate(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.VertexBufferBindings)




I tried to convert *.x file to *.dae 
https://www.ofoct.com/3d-model-file-for-3d-printer-converter/3d-model-file-converter.html

and then used Autodesk FBX converter to convert *.dae to *.fbx but still got the same error

If I remove the following line then ground.x file renders OK without error
this first test was on Windows
Therefore clone CModel and try again
